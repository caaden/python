Client/Server
    -most basic pattern
    -client sends request (REQ)
    -server responds (RES)
    -zmq REQ sockets can connect to many servers
        -REQ is a client definition
        -if two servers, the requests will be interleaved or distributed to both servers
    -unlike PAIR, Client/Server will block
        -for PAIR, any number of messages sent between peers
        -each Request/Reply is paired and must be successful
        -socket zmq.REQ will block on send() unless it recieved a reply back
        -socket zmq.REP will block on recv() unless it has received a request
